i change task 3
i go task 2 and text content has changed, not sql

now if i edit any task, it edits all tasks that i have clicked show More on


if past due date, colors change
in the popup, inputs are disabled unless specified otherwise

if i start the application and the session id is gone, always redirect to home page


make the tasks smaller


so the application waits that all is gotten before loading dom content

name or date cannot be null when creating or editing


have a dashboard page  that has login and register button and if request is good, the buttons div removes the buttons and appends txt with the username and nb tasks


there's no verification yet
