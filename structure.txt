I will have to start by structuring the MySQL tables :
- One table for the user (id,username,email,password,dateCreated,listingsNumber)
- One table for tasks (userId,taskId,taskTitle,taskDescription,dayCreated,toBeFinishedBy)

Certainly! Let's break down the different parts of a Task Management app and discuss how you can structure each component:

1. User Authentication and Authorization:
   - Implement user registration and login functionality using Node.js frameworks like Express.js.
   - Store user credentials securely in a database, such as MongoDB or PostgreSQL.
   - Utilize authentication middleware, such as Passport.js, for session management and user authorization.
   - Make a separate html file for registration/login
   - Need to check if user is logged in, then send a separate index.html file if he is

2. Task Management:
   - Create a database schema to store tasks, including fields such as task title, description, due date, priority, and completion status.
   - Design the user interface to display tasks in a list or card format, allowing users to view, create, update, and delete tasks.
   - Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) in combination with RESTful API endpoints.

3. Task Notifications and Reminders:
   - Set up a system to send task notifications and reminders to users via email or push notifications.
   - Implement a scheduler that periodically checks for upcoming tasks and sends notifications accordingly.
   - Integrate third-party services like SendGrid or Firebase Cloud Messaging to handle notifications.

4. User Settings and Preferences:
   - Provide users with the ability to customize their task management experience.
   - Allow users to set their preferred notification settings, such as email frequency or notification channels.
   - Implement user profile pages where users can update their information, change passwords, and manage account settings.

5. Collaborative Features (optional):
   - Extend your app to support collaboration if multiple users need to work together on tasks.
   - Implement features like task assignment, task sharing, or comments for users to communicate and collaborate within the app.
   - Use real-time communication technologies like WebSockets or a library like Socket.IO to enable instant updates and notifications across users.

6. Data Persistence:
   - Choose a database system (SQL or NoSQL) to store user information, task details, and other relevant data.
   - Design the database schema and establish relationships between tables or collections.
   - Use an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library like Mongoose or Sequelize to interact with the database from your Node.js application.

7. User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX):
   - Develop an intuitive and user-friendly interface to interact with tasks and manage user settings.
   - Utilize modern front-end frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js to build responsive and dynamic UI components.
   - Implement client-side form validation, error handling, and feedback mechanisms to enhance the user experience.

Remember to modularize your codebase into reusable components, use proper error handling and validation techniques, and follow best practices for security (e.g., input sanitization, authentication, and authorization).
